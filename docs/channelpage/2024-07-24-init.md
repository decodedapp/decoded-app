# 🗓️ 2024-12-19 Channel Page Development - Progress Update

## Summary

Started development for channel page overall layout and design (UI/UX), API integration, and functional elements (channel item click and main page transition).

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Structure

- `src/domains/channels/page.tsx`: Basic page layout
- `src/domains/channels/components/hero/ChannelHero.tsx`: Hero section
- `src/domains/channels/components/category-grid/`: Category grid related components
  - `MasonryGrid.tsx`: Main grid component
  - `CategoryGrid.tsx`: Category grid
  - `GridItem.tsx`: Individual item component
  - `CtaCard.tsx`: CTA card component
  - `CategoryFilter.tsx`: Category filter

### API Structure

- `src/api/generated/services/PublicService.ts`: Public API service
- `src/api/generated/models/`: API models (CategoryDoc, ItemDoc, etc.)

## Development Checklist

### 🎨 UI/UX Design & Layout

- [x] Overall layout structure improvement
- [x] Responsive design optimization (mobile/desktop)
- [x] Design system tokens application
- [x] Animation and transition effects
- [ ] Accessibility improvements
- [ ] Loading and error state UI implementation

### 🔧 Functional Features

- [x] Channel item click event implementation
- [x] Main page transition functionality
- [x] Category filtering functionality
- [ ] Search functionality (if needed)
- [ ] Infinite scroll or pagination
- [ ] Bookmark/like functionality (if needed)

### 🔌 API Integration

- [ ] Data fetching using React Query
- [ ] API error handling
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation
- [ ] Loading state management
- [ ] Data update logic

### 📱 State Management

- [ ] Zustand store setup
- [ ] Global state management
- [ ] Local state optimization
- [ ] State persistence (if needed)

### 🧪 Testing & Quality

- [ ] Unit test writing
- [ ] Integration test writing
- [ ] Storybook stories writing
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] Code review and refactoring

## Key Decisions

- **Design System**: Utilize existing Tailwind configuration and design tokens
- **State Management**: Use Zustand + React Query combination
- **API Integration**: Utilize existing generated API client
- **Component Structure**: Maintain Toss-style domain-based structure
- **Performance**: Apply image optimization, code splitting, memoization

## Technical Requirements

### Required Features

1. **Channel Item Click**: Transition to detail page or main page when item is clicked
2. **Category Filtering**: Filter items by category
3. **Responsive Layout**: Optimized UI for all devices
4. **API Integration**: Real-time data fetching and updates

### Performance Requirements

- Initial loading time < 2 seconds
- Image optimization (WebP, lazy loading)
- Scroll performance optimization
- Memory usage optimization
