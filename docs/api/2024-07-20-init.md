# üóìÔ∏è 2024-12-19 API Integration & Optimization - Progress Update

## Summary

Started the migration and optimization of API integration using typgen, react-query, and Zustand. This document tracks all key tasks, decisions, issues, and progress logs for the API layer refactoring.

## API Integration Checklist

- [x] Document API endpoint structure
- [x] Automate and utilize types with typgen
- [ ] Design react-query patterns (caching, error handling, etc.)
- [ ] Design and implement Zustand store structure
- [x] Summarize differences and migration strategy from legacy network code
- [ ] Provide code examples and FAQ

## Key Decisions

- All API integration will be unified with react-query
- Global state will be managed with Zustand store
- Type management will be automated with typgen
- Gradual migration from legacy network code

## Issues & Solutions

- [2024-06-24] Found duplicated data fetching in SSR.  
  Solution: Unified data fetching with useQuery.
- [2024-12-19] API type generation successfully implemented with CI/CD pipeline.

## API Integration Log

- [2024-06-24] **Initial documentation structure and checklist created**
- [2024-06-24] **Decided on unified API/data layer architecture**
- [2024-12-19] **API type generation setup completed**
  - Implemented typgen for automatic type generation
  - Setup CI/CD pipeline for API type updates
  - Generated API client services and models
  - Task Master integration for project management

## Completed Work

- [x] API type generation with typgen
- [x] CI/CD pipeline for automatic type updates
- [x] Generated API client services (PublicService, AuthService, etc.)
- [x] Generated API models (CategoryDoc, ItemDoc, UserDoc, etc.)
- [x] Task Master integration for project management

## Next Steps

- Implement React Query patterns for data fetching
- Design and implement Zustand store structure
- Provide code examples and FAQ documentation
- Start code refactoring and optimization based on this plan
