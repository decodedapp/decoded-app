# üóìÔ∏è 2024-06-24 API Integration & Optimization - Initialization

## Summary

Started the migration and optimization of API integration using typgen, react-query, and Zustand. This document tracks all key tasks, decisions, issues, and progress logs for the API layer refactoring.

## API Integration Checklist

- [ ] Document API endpoint structure
- [ ] Automate and utilize types with typgen
- [ ] Design react-query patterns (caching, error handling, etc.)
- [ ] Design and implement Zustand store structure
- [ ] Summarize differences and migration strategy from legacy network code
- [ ] Provide code examples and FAQ

## Key Decisions

- All API integration will be unified with react-query
- Global state will be managed with Zustand store
- Type management will be automated with typgen
- Gradual migration from legacy network code

## Issues & Solutions

- [2024-06-24] Found duplicated data fetching in SSR.  
  Solution: Unified data fetching with useQuery.

## API Integration Log

- [2024-06-24] **Initial documentation structure and checklist created**
- [2024-06-24] **Decided on unified API/data layer architecture**

## Next Steps

- Write detailed documentation for each checklist item
- Start code refactoring and optimization based on this plan
