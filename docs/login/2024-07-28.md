# üóìÔ∏è 2024-07-28 Login Feature Development - Progress Update

## Summary

Started the development of the login feature for the v2 application. Analyzed the existing API structure and created a comprehensive development checklist for all authentication-related components and functionality.

## Development Checklist

- [ ] Login form component design and implementation
- [ ] Authentication API integration (react-query)
- [ ] Form validation and error handling
- [ ] State management for authentication (Zustand store)
- [ ] Responsive design and accessibility
- [ ] Loading states and user feedback
- [ ] Session management and token storage
- [ ] Protected route implementation
- [ ] Logout functionality
- [ ] User profile integration
- [ ] Error boundary and fallback UI
- [ ] Testing and documentation

## Key Decisions

- Use the existing AuthService from the generated API client
- Implement form validation using react-hook-form or similar
- Store authentication tokens securely using httpOnly cookies or secure storage
- Follow the established design system tokens and component patterns
- Implement proper error handling and user feedback
- Use Zustand for global authentication state management

## API Integration Plan

Based on the generated API client, we have access to:

- `AuthService.login()` - POST /auth/login
- `AuthService.logout()` - POST /auth/logout
- `AuthService.refresh()` - POST /auth/refresh
- User data models and types are already generated

## Issues & Solutions

- [2024-12-19] Need to analyze existing API structure and authentication flow
- [2024-12-19] Determine the best approach for token storage and session management

## Development Log

- [2024-12-19] **Initial setup and planning completed**
  - Created feature branch: `feature/login-implementation`
  - Analyzed existing API client structure
  - Identified authentication service endpoints
  - Created development documentation structure
  - See commit: `feat(login): Initialize login feature development branch`

## Completed Work

- [x] Feature branch creation and setup
- [x] API structure analysis
- [x] Development documentation initialization
- [x] Authentication service endpoint identification

## Next Steps

- Design and implement login form component
- Set up authentication state management with Zustand
- Implement form validation and error handling
- Integrate with AuthService API endpoints
- Add loading states and user feedback
- Implement session management
- Create protected route wrapper
- Add logout functionality
- Test authentication flow end-to-end

## Technical Requirements

### Authentication Flow

1. User enters credentials in login form
2. Form validation (client-side)
3. API call to AuthService.login()
4. Store authentication tokens securely
5. Update global authentication state
6. Redirect to protected route or dashboard
7. Handle error cases and user feedback

### State Management

- Global authentication state (Zustand)
- Form state management
- Loading states
- Error states

### Security Considerations

- Secure token storage
- CSRF protection
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure logout implementation
- Session timeout handling

### UI/UX Requirements

- Responsive design
- Accessibility compliance
- Loading indicators
- Error messages
- Success feedback
- Consistent with design system
