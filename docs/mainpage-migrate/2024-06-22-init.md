# üóìÔ∏è 2024-06-14 Main Page Migration - Initialization

## Summary

Started the migration of the legacy main page to the v2 structure. Analyzed the old codebase and created a migration checklist for all key UI components and features.

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Header design, functionality, and layout separation
- [ ] API data integration (react-query)
- [ ] Optimize and verify all API performance
- [ ] State management (Zustand store)
- [x] Responsive layout (base structure)
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Navigation bar
- [ ] Loading and error states
- [ ] Optimize main page scroll functionality
- [ ] Remove legacy/unused code

## Key Decisions

- Adopt the new design system tokens for all UI components.
- Use react-query for API integration and Zustand for state management.
- Follow Toss-style directory and code structure.
- **Header and main layout separated and implemented as fixed, transparent, and responsive.**
- **Main container uses padding-top to avoid overlap with header, and applies design tokens for spacing and background.**

## Issues & Solutions

- [2024-06-22] Found duplicated data fetching in SSR. Solution: Unified data fetching with useQuery.

## Migration Log

- [2024-06-22] **Initial global layout setup completed.**
  - Implemented fixed transparent header with blur on scroll
  - Responsive spacing and height (mobile/desktop)
  - Main container separated from header, with proper padding
  - Applied design tokens and Tailwind config rules
  - See commit: `feat(layout): Add global header and responsive main layout`

## Next Steps

- Begin migrating core UI components.
- Set up API data integration and state management.
- Document all progress and decisions in this folder.
