# üóìÔ∏è 2024-12-19 Main Page Migration - Progress Update

## Summary

Started the migration of the legacy main page to the v2 structure. Analyzed the old codebase and created a migration checklist for all key UI components and features.

## Migration Checklist

- [x] Header design, functionality, and layout separation
- [ ] API data integration (react-query)
- [ ] Optimize and verify all API performance
- [ ] State management (Zustand store)
- [x] Responsive layout (base structure)
- [ ] Accessibility features
- [ ] Navigation bar
- [ ] Loading and error states
- [x] Optimize main page scroll functionality
- [ ] Remove legacy/unused code

## Key Decisions

- Adopt the new design system tokens for all UI components.
- Use react-query for API integration and Zustand for state management.
- Follow Toss-style directory and code structure.
- **Header and main layout separated and implemented as fixed, transparent, and responsive.**
- **Main container uses padding-top to avoid overlap with header, and applies design tokens for spacing and background.**

## Issues & Solutions

- [2024-06-22] Found duplicated data fetching in SSR. Solution: Unified data fetching with useQuery.
