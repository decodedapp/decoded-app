# ThiingsGrid Migration & Refactoring Log

## Overview

ThiingsGrid is the infinite omnidirectional scroll grid component for the main page.
This document tracks the migration, refactoring, and testing process from legacy to v2.

## Migration Steps

- [x] Initial code copy from backup to `src/domains/main/ThiingsGrid.tsx`
- [x] Remove legacy dependencies, props, and state
- [x] Refactor to use v2 data/state management (store, react-query, etc)
- [x] Apply design system/tokens for all styles
- [ ] Add tests, Storybook stories, and documentation

## Key Decisions

- Only essential logic and UI are migrated; unnecessary legacy code will be removed.
- All styles must use Tailwind design tokens.
- State management will be unified with v2 store/react-query.

## Issues & Solutions

- [2024-06-23] Found direct function props from server to client: fixed by making MainPage a client component.

## Completed Work

- [x] ThiingsGrid component migration and integration with main page layout
- [x] Infinite scroll grid implementation (WIP)
- [x] Grid layout improvements with fisheye hover effects
- [x] Fashion categories and editor avatar stack implementation
- [x] Dark theme layout optimization
- [x] Grid image marker and scroll refactoring
- [x] Main offset moving animation refactor
- [x] Grid layout improvements with fisheye hover effects and outline optimization
- [x] URL and flag icons removal for cleaner design
- [x] Dark theme layout improvements

## TODO

- [ ] Complete infinite scroll implementation
- [ ] Refactor props and types for clarity and maintainability
