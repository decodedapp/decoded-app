reviewPrompts:
  - "Are only theme-defined colors, spacing values, and typography tokens used?"
  - "Does the component layout follow the spacing and grid system defined by the design system?"
  - "Is typography used according to the type scale (e.g., heading vs. body vs. caption)?"
  - "Are semantic component names used to match design intent (e.g., PrimaryButton, AlertCard)?"
  - "Is the visual hierarchy of the UI aligned with the design tokens?"
