reviewPrompts:
  - 'Is ESLint and Prettier properly configured and consistently applied across the codebase?'
  - 'Is the TypeScript path alias (`@/`) used consistently instead of relative imports?'
  - 'Do commit messages follow the conventional commit format (e.g., feat: add X)?'
  - 'Are developer tooling setups (linters, formatters, etc.) defined and shared in the repository?'
  - 'Is the tooling environment reproducible for all team members (e.g., with consistent configs, lockfiles)?'
